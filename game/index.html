            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use 
                your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you 
                from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, 
                who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that 
                you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the 
                monsters to the point where they explode. [...]
