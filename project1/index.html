                a reticle to shoot at enemies and takes cover to reload allowing them to strategically
                plan their attacks.<br>SETTING:<br>
                Nikke takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where the Earth was suddenly attacked and overrun by
                extraterrestrial mechanical creatures called Raptures that destroyed everything on the surface, forcing
                the remaining humans to take refuge underground and establish the Ark, a metropolis ruled by the
                Central Government. The story is played from the perspective of the Commander, who graduated from the
                Military Academy one day prior to the events of the game, and his squad of Nikkes as they endeavor to
                reclaim the surface.
                Despite their lack of experience, they perform extraordinarily
                in the operations and survive various encounters with rare Rapture species throughout the journey.
                They lead a squad called Counters, which consists of the Nikkes Anis, Rapi and later down the story,
                Neon. The Commander views Nikkes with sympathy and privately advocates for Nikke rights, which is
                illegal in accordance with the laws of the Ark. Outlaws may be sent to the Rehabilitation Center or
                the Outer Rim, an area fully isolated from the rest of the Ark, and they have formed terrorist
                organizations claiming to fight for human rights for themselves.
