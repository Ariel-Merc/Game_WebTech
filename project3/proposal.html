    </header>

    <main>
        <h2>1. High Concept</h2>
        <p>Catch the stars as they fall from the sky and gain points. 
            Dropping stars or catching the wrong star will cause you to lose lives until
            game over.
        </p><br>

        <h2>2. Genre</h2>
        <p>This game is a catcher game.</p><br>

        <h2>3. Platform</h2>
        <p>This game is for desktop web.</p><br>

        <h2>4. Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>The style will be pixel art</p><br>

        <h2>5. Gameplay</h2>
        <p> Stars will fall from the top of the screen. The player will control a character who will run along 
            the bottom of the screen. (possibly have the ability to jump to higher platforms?)
            When the player collides with a star, they will "catch" it.
